# Azure AI Foundry RAG Sample with Azure AI Search

> **Disclaimer:** This repository is provided purely as a demonstration of these workflows. You are free to use, modify, and adapt the code as you see fit; however, it is offered as-is with no warranty or support of any kind. Use it at your own risk. This is not production-ready code — it should be reviewed, understood, and rewritten to suit your own environment before any real-world use.

This repository demonstrates how to build a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution using Azure AI Foundry. The solution connects an AI Agent to document data stored in Azure Blob Storage through Azure AI Search, with secure access via Azure API Management (APIM).

## Architecture Overview

The solution deploys the following resources:

*   **Azure OpenAI Service:** Hosts the GPT model and AI Agent.
*   **Azure AI Foundry Project:** Manages the AI Agent configuration.
*   **Azure AI Search:** Indexes documents from blob storage and provides semantic search capabilities for RAG.
*   **Azure Storage Account:** Stores source documents (invoice .txt files) in a blob container named `test`.
*   **Azure API Management:** Acts as the secure gateway and entry point for all client requests.
*   **Virtual Network (VNet):** Provides a secure network boundary.
*   **Private Endpoint:** Connects the VNet securely to the Azure OpenAI service.
*   **Private DNS Zone:** Ensures proper DNS resolution for the private endpoint.
*   **Supporting Services:** Key Vault, Application Insights, and Log Analytics for observability.

## How RAG Works in This Solution

1.  **Document Storage:** Invoice documents (`.txt` files) are uploaded to the Storage Account's `test` container by the user.
2.  **Indexing Pipeline:** An Azure AI Search indexer automatically:
    *   Connects to the blob container via a datasource (configured with managed identity)
    *   Extracts content and metadata from documents using a skillset
    *   Applies AI skills including key phrase extraction
    *   Populates the search index (`ragdocs`) with indexed content
3.  **Agent Query:** When a user asks a question through the AI Agent:
    *   The agent uses Azure AI Search to find relevant document chunks from the indexed invoices
    *   Retrieved context is combined with the user's question
    *   The GPT model generates a grounded response based on the indexed documents
4.  **Secure Access:** All agent interactions flow through APIM, which enforces authentication and routing policies.

## Security Posture

This architecture prioritizes security by minimizing public exposure and using identity-based authentication.

### Network Security
*   **Private Backend:** Public network access to the Azure OpenAI service is **disabled**. It can only be accessed via its Private Endpoint.
*   **VNet Integration:**
    *   **APIM:** Deployed in "External" mode within a dedicated subnet (`snet-apim`). This allows it to accept public traffic while having direct access to private resources in the VNet.
    *   **OpenAI:** Connected to the VNet via a Private Endpoint in a dedicated subnet (`snet-pe`).
*   **Traffic Flow:** All traffic between APIM and OpenAI travels over the Microsoft Azure backbone network, never traversing the public internet.

### Authentication & Authorization
*   **Identity-Based Access:** The solution is configured to use Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) tokens.
*   **Token Pass-through:** API Management is configured to pass the client's `Authorization` header (Bearer token) directly to the OpenAI backend.
*   **No Static Keys:** The APIM configuration does not store or inject static API keys for the backend connection, reducing the risk of credential leakage.

### API Policy
*   **CORS:** A Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is applied to allow safe cross-origin requests from web clients.
*   **Token Limiting:** An `llm-token-limit` policy is configured to manage consumption, limiting usage to 5,000 tokens per minute and 50,000 tokens per hour per IP address.

## Data Path

1.  **Client Request:** A user or application sends an HTTPS request to the public API Management endpoint.
    *   URL: `https://apim-<workload>-<env>-<suffix>.azure-api.net/agent/...`
    *   Header: `Authorization: Bearer <valid-azure-ad-token>`
2.  **Gateway Entry:** The request hits the APIM Gateway.
3.  **DNS Resolution:** APIM, running inside the VNet, queries the `privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com` Private DNS Zone to resolve the OpenAI/Foundry hostname.
4.  **Private Routing:** The DNS zone returns the **Private IP** address of the backend service.
5.  **Backend Access:** APIM forwards the request securely through the VNet to the Private Endpoint of the Azure AI Foundry Project.
6.  **Response:** The model processes the request and returns the response via the same secure path.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
*   Azure CLI (`az`)
*   Terraform (>= 1.0)
*   PowerShell
*   An active Azure Subscription with sufficient permissions to create resources and assign RBAC roles

### Optional Terraform Inputs

The dev example keeps the existing deployment behavior by default. Set `enable_apim = false` to skip APIM and its API operations, or set `enable_rbac = false` when role assignments are managed manually. The role-assignment resources remain in `terraform/project/main.tf` and are enabled again by setting `enable_rbac = true`.

To use networking created by another team, set `use_existing_network = true` and provide `existing_network_resource_group_name`, `existing_vnet_name`, and `existing_private_endpoint_subnet_name`. Also provide `existing_apim_subnet_name` when APIM is enabled. Terraform reads these resources with AzureRM data sources instead of creating the VNet and subnets.

The agent definition defaults to `terraform/modules/azurerm/ai_agent/agent_definition.yaml.tftpl`. Set `agent_definition_template_file` to use a custom YAML template; Terraform interpolates the agent name, model deployment, search connection ID, and index name while leaving the instructions in YAML.

The dev example also includes a commented GPT-5.6 Luna profile (`gpt-5.6-luna`, version `2026-07-09`). Check model availability and quota for the target region before enabling it. GPT-5.6 tool calling is documented through the Responses API, so confirm compatibility with this sample's Assistants-style agent creation flow before switching.

### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure

#### Option A: Local Deployment (Manual)

1.  Navigate to the `terraform/environments/dev` directory:
    ```bash
    cd terraform/environments/dev
    ```

2.  Copy the example variables file:
    ```bash
    cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
    ```

3.  Update `terraform.tfvars` with your specific values (e.g., `subscription_id`, `workload`, `apim_publisher_email`).

4.  Initialize Terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

    State is stored locally by default. To use remote state in Azure Storage instead, create `backend.tf` in this folder before running init:
    ```hcl
    terraform {
      backend "azurerm" {
        resource_group_name  = "rg-tfstate"
        storage_account_name = "sttfstatedev"
        container_name       = "tfstate"
        key                  = "aifoundry-rag.tfstate"
        use_azuread_auth     = true
      }
    }
    ```

5.  **First Apply** - Deploy the infrastructure:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    
    **Note:** With `enable_rbac = true`, the first apply may encounter role-assignment propagation delays while managed identities are created.

6.  **Second Apply** - Complete role assignments:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    
    When `enable_rbac = true`, run apply again after identity propagation to complete role assignments. When `enable_rbac = false`, provision the required roles manually before creating or using the agent.

7.  **Capture Outputs:** Note the following Terraform outputs for later steps:
    *   `resource_group_name`
    *   `search_service_name`
    *   `cognitive_service_endpoint`
    *   `search_service_endpoint`

### Option B: Deploy via GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment, destruction, and backend bootstrapping.

#### 1. Create a Service Principal with OIDC Federation

Create an Entra ID app registration and configure federated credentials for GitHub Actions (no client secret required):

```powershell
# Set your values
$GITHUB_ORG = "<your-github-org-or-username>"
$GITHUB_REPO = "<your-repo-name>"
$SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "<your-azure-subscription-id>"

# Create the app registration
$APP_ID = az ad app create --display-name "github-actions-aifoundry" --query appId -o tsv

# Create the service principal
$SP_OBJECT_ID = az ad sp create --id $APP_ID --query id -o tsv

# Assign Owner on the subscription (needed for resource creation + RBAC assignments)
az role assignment create `
  --role "Owner" `
  --assignee-object-id $SP_OBJECT_ID `
  --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal `
  --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"

# Add federated credential for the "dev" environment
$devParams = (@{
  name      = "github-env-dev"
  issuer    = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
  subject   = "repo:${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}:environment:dev"
  audiences = @("api://AzureADTokenExchange")
} | ConvertTo-Json -Compress) -replace '"', '\"'
az ad app federated-credential create --id $APP_ID --parameters $devParams

# Add federated credential for the main branch (used by the plan job)
$mainParams = (@{
  name      = "github-ref-main"
  issuer    = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
  subject   = "repo:${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}:ref:refs/heads/main"
  audiences = @("api://AzureADTokenExchange")
} | ConvertTo-Json -Compress) -replace '"', '\"'
az ad app federated-credential create --id $APP_ID --parameters $mainParams

# Print the values you need for GitHub secrets
$TENANT_ID = az account show --query tenantId -o tsv
Write-Host "AZURE_CLIENT_ID=$APP_ID"
Write-Host "AZURE_TENANT_ID=$TENANT_ID"
Write-Host "AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

#### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets & Variables

In your repository go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.

**Secrets** (sensitive):

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | App registration client/application ID (from step above) |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD / Entra ID tenant ID |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Target Azure subscription ID |

**Variables** (non-sensitive — set after bootstrapping the backend in step 3):

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `TF_BACKEND_RESOURCE_GROUP` | Resource group for Terraform state storage | `rg-tfstate` |
| `TF_BACKEND_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` | Storage account name for state | `sttfstatedev` |
| `TF_BACKEND_CONTAINER` | Blob container name | `tfstate` |
| `TF_BACKEND_KEY` | State file blob name | `aifoundry-rag.tfstate` |

Also create a **`dev` environment** under **Settings > Environments** (optional: add required reviewers as an approval gate).

#### 3. Bootstrap the Terraform State Backend

Run the **"Bootstrap Terraform Backend"** workflow from **Actions > Bootstrap Terraform Backend > Run workflow**. Provide the resource group name, storage account name, container name, and Azure region. The workflow will:

- Create the resource group and storage account (TLS 1.2, no public blob access)
- Create the blob container
- Grant the service principal `Storage Blob Data Contributor` on the storage account

After it completes, set the four `TF_BACKEND_*` variables listed above using the values from the workflow summary.

#### 4. Deploy

Push to `main` (changes under `terraform/`) or manually trigger the **"Deploy Infrastructure"** workflow. It runs `terraform plan`, then `terraform apply` twice (to handle RBAC propagation) with an environment approval gate.

#### 5. Destroy

Manually trigger the **"Destroy Infrastructure"** workflow from **Actions > Destroy Infrastructure > Run workflow**. You must type `destroy` in the confirmation input to proceed.

### Step 2: Grant Your User Storage Access

Before uploading documents, grant your Entra ID account `Storage Blob Data Contributor` access on the storage account

**Wait 2-5 minutes** for the role assignment to propagate before proceeding to the next step.

### Step 3: Upload Invoice Documents

Upload your invoice `.txt` files to the `test` container in the storage account. This solution is designed to work with generic invoice data in plain text format.

**Example Invoice Format (.txt):**
```
Invoice Number: INV-2024-001
Customer ID: CUST-12345
Date: 2024-01-15
Amount: $1,250.00
Description: Professional Services
...
```

### Step 4: Run the Search Indexer

After uploading documents, trigger the indexer to process and index the documents:

**Verify Indexing:**
*   Check the indexer status in the Azure Portal: Navigate to your Search Service → **Indexers** → `doc-indexer`
*   Wait for the indexer to complete (status should show "Success")
*   Verify documents are indexed: Check the document count in the search index (`ragdocs`)

### Step 5: Test the Agent

#### Option A: Azure AI Foundry Studio (Recommended)

1.  Navigate to [Azure AI Foundry Studio](https://ai.azure.com)
2.  Sign in with your Azure account
3.  Open your AI project (format: `<workload>-<env>-<suffix>`)
4.  Go to **Agents** in the left navigation
5.  Select your agent: `agent-<workload>-<env>-<suffix>`
6.  Use the **Playground** to test queries:
    *   "What invoices do we have?"
    *   "Show me details for invoice INV-2024-001"
    *   "What's the total amount for customer CUST-12345?"
    *   "List all invoices from January 2024"

The agent should retrieve relevant information from your indexed invoice documents.

## Usage

### Web Application
1.  Open `app/index.html` in your browser.
2.  Fill in the configuration:
    *   **Agent API Base URL:** Enter the `apim_gateway_url` output with the `/agent` suffix (e.g., `https://apim-....azure-api.net/agent`).
    *   **Agent Name/ID:** Enter the Agent ID from the Foundry Studio (e.g., `asst_...`).
    *   **API Version:** Default is `v1` (for Foundry Agents) or `2024-05-01-preview` (for Azure OpenAI).
    *   **Access Token:** Generate a token using:
        ```bash
        az account get-access-token --resource https://ai.azure.com --query accessToken -o tsv
        ```
3.  Start chatting!

## Search Index Schema

The Azure AI Search index (`ragdocs`) includes the following fields designed for invoice data:

*   `id` - Unique identifier (key)
*   `parent_id` - Parent document reference
*   `content` - Full text content
*   `blob_url` - Source blob URL
*   `metadata_storage_path` - Storage path
*   `metadata_storage_name` - File name
*   `metadata_storage_last_modified` - Last modified timestamp
*   `metadata_storage_size` - File size
*   `invoiceNo` - Invoice number (searchable, filterable, facetable)
*   `customerId` - Customer identifier (searchable, filterable, facetable)

The indexer uses a skillset with key phrase extraction to enhance search quality.

## Troubleshooting

### Indexer Fails to Run
*   Verify the Search service has `Storage Blob Data Reader` role on the Storage Account
*   Check that documents exist in the `test` container
*   Review indexer execution history in Azure Portal

### Agent Returns Generic Responses
*   Verify documents are indexed: Check document count in Search service
*   Ensure the agent is connected to the correct search index (`ragdocs`)
*   Test search directly in the Azure Portal Search Explorer

### RBAC Permission Errors
*   Wait 2-5 minutes after role assignments for propagation
*   Run `terraform apply` a second time to resolve timing issues
*   Verify you're logged in with `az account show`

### Token Expired
*   Access tokens expire after 1 hour
*   Regenerate with: `az account get-access-token --resource https://ai.azure.com --query accessToken -o tsv`
